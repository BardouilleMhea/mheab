The first step in this process was the creation of a [project proposal](/mheab/project-proposal), which would define our individual project and include the research questions we were striving to answer, why we were interested in this topic, and the Digital Humanities tools we were going to use to create this project.

Once this was created, we began our research into our chosen topic through the use of archival, primary, and secondary sources that provide insight and context for this topic. We then created an [annotated bibliography](/mheab/annotated-bib) that summarized the resources and explained their relevance to our topic as well as how the information will be used in the project.
