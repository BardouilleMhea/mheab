Hi there, my name is Mhea Bardouille, and I am a soon-to-be graduate of the [Dominica State College (DSC)] (http://dsc.edu.dm/), where I double majored in accounting and information technology.During my academic tenure, my passion for these disciplines has deepened, but it has also piqued my interest in disciplinary fields that deal with the practical application of technology into business environments, such as Computer Information Systems.

At the [Dominica State College (DSCS)] (http://dsc.edu.dm/), I was involved in a variety of student clubs, including the DSC Literary and Debating Society, the DSC Environmental Club, the DSC Business League, and the [Create Caribbean Research Institute] (https://createcaribbean.org/create/), which all contributed to my personal development and imporvement of hard skills like coding and soft skills like time management.

In my free time, I like to watch movies and series, paint, and read, especially the literary works of female Caribbean authors like Jamaica Kincaid and Edwidge Danticat.
