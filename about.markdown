Hi there, my name is Mhea Bardouille, and I am a second-year accounting and information technology student at Dominica State College. My passion for these disciplines has deepened due to my undergraduate studies, but it has also piqued my interest in interdisciplinary fields that bridge technology and business, such as Computer Information Systems, which I hope to undertake in the future. My associate degree has also increased my passion for coding since I was first introduced to the programming language C++ at Convent High School, and as such, inmy free time, I learn new coding languages and programming techniques to improve my skills. My other interests include painting and reading, particularly writings from the Caribbean authorsâ€™ Jamaica Kincaid and Edwidge Danticat. I am also a self-acclaimed movie and film critic.
