## Mhea Bardouille: HIS115- Course Blog 


 Why, hello there! My name is [Mhea Bardouille](/mheab/about), and I am a soon-to-be graduate of [Dominica State College (DSC)](https://dsc.edu.dm/), where I majored in Accounting and Information Technology. During my tenure at DSC I enrolled in [HIS 115: Digital Humanities](https://www.createcaribbean.org/his115/) as part of my internship at [Create Caribbean Research Institute](https://createcaribbean.org/create/). Through this course and program my appreciation for research has expeditiously increased as I acquired new skills and learned technical tools to analyze and visualize my research findings.

This site, created using the static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), will contain reflections and summaries of the different Digital Humanities readings, projects, and tools covered in HIS115 with our lecturer, Dr. Schuyler Esprit, and provide insight into my thought process and the ideas and creative process of building the class project, Writers, Readers, and Scenes: Visualizing Caribbean Literature, and my individual project, **project name**. 


Hope you have a good  time navigating this site!
